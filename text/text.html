            <P id="get">Google is best known for its search engine, although
                Google now offers a number of other services.</P>
            <p class="mission">Google's mission is to organize the world's
                information and make it<em> universally accessible and
                    useful.</em></p>
            <p>Its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started

            <p>Welcome to example cafe. We will be developing this site throughout
                the book.</p>
            <h3>A community cafe serving home cooked, locally sourced, organic food</h3>
            <p id="ocean">With stunning views of the ocean, Example Cafe offers the perfect
                environment to unwind and recharge the batteries.</p>
            <p>Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches,
                including a range of vegetarian options.</p>
            <p>Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you never
                need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch the world go by.</p>
            <h3>This weekend's special brunch</h3>
            <p id="weekend">This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
                on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
                that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
                four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
